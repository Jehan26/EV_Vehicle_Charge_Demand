## Overview

This project is part of **AICTE Internship Cycle 2 - July 2025** and focuses on predicting electric vehicle (EV) charging demand. The objective is to forecast the expected demand at EV charging stations using historical data and contextual factors such as:

- Date and time trends
- Weather conditions
- Geographic location
- Nearby infrastructure
- EV population density

## Project Structure


## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Historical charging station logs, weather data, and location-based datasets were collected.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaned and merged datasets, created time-based and categorical features, normalized data.
3. **Model Development**:
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest
   - LSTM for time series forecasting
4. **Model Evaluation**: Used RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score to assess performance.

## Use Case

Example scenario: Predict the number of vehicles expected to charge at a specific station in Bengaluru on a rainy Monday evening using past trends and weather conditions.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git, GitHub
